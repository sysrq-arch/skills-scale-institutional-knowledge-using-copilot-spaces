OctoAcme runs projects with a clear, stage‑based process that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation focuses on validating the business need with a Project One‑pager (problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline and risks) and a go/no‑go decision gate. Planning breaks approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, a Definition of Done, and a release plan; dependencies and risks are captured in a Risk Register and marked on the project board so cross‑team issues are visible and escalated.

Execution is organized around a lightweight agile rhythm: daily standups to surface progress and blockers, a weekly delivery sync to share status and risks, and demos at the end of sprints or milestones. Workflow is driven by a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined PR process (small PRs when possible—target ≤400 lines—PRs must link to issues and acceptance criteria, run CI tests and linters, and require at least one approval before merge). Key artifacts—backlog items with acceptance criteria, release notes, risk register entries, and retrospective action items—are kept in the repo so there's a single source of truth.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules and communications, Developers implement and test features, QA validates acceptance criteria and runs integration/e2e checks, and Stakeholders provide input and approvals. Communication cadence includes weekly PM/PdM alignment, twice‑weekly or agreed team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates; incident and escalation paths are defined (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and security incidents follow the security runbook.

Quality assurance is built into the lifecycle: unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, and end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows before release; CI runs tests and security scans automatically. Releases follow a checklist (staging verification, smoke tests, rollback plan, and post‑deploy verification) and use a release notes template. Continuous improvement is enforced through regular retrospectives that generate prioritized action items tracked back into the backlog so process changes are measurable and iterated on.
